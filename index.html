							AZPixels is a Web Applications &amp; UI/UX development company. We build,
							consult, and maintain websites ranging from mom-&amp;-pop shops to
							large-scale web applications.

							Technology is at the heart of this company, so if you prefer to work with only one 
							company to deliver your entire product, we can do that.
							We also love to mix our talents with others so if you only need us to supplement
							specific services, we'd love to help there too.
						</p><p>
							AZPixels also believes that we can serve your best interest by ensuring
							you own the product we create for you, your domain, and your hosting account.
							In other words, you will own and control your assets. For these and many other
							reasons, we want you to feel comfortable with a web developer you can trust.
